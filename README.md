Neural Network for MNIST Classification
This code defines and trains a neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. 
The neural network consists of three dense layers with 128, 64, and 16 units respectively and uses the 'relu' and 'softmax' activation functions. 
The model is compiled with the 'adam' optimizer and the 'categorical_crossentropy' loss function and is evaluated on the test set using the accuracy function. 
The test accuracy is printed to the console.
